# Programming HW1: Make a To-Do App with Node.js and MongoDB

I worked my way through the To-Do App Tutorial provided: https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-1-c645c7a27583 

## Instructions to use this App: 
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
2. Make sure you have these packages installed: Express, mongoose, ejs and dotenv <br>
The following code to install Express, mongoose, ejs and dotenv<br>
```npm install --save express mongoose ejs dotenv``` <br>
The following code installs nodemon <br>
```npm install --save-dev nodemon``` <br>
2. Download or clone the project files from this GitHub repository
3. Open a terminal navigate to the project directory "hw_1"
4. Install the project dependencies by running the command "npm install" 
5. Start the Node.js server by running the command "node index.js"
6. Open a web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/" to view the prototype.


Once you have the prototype up and running, you can create new tasks, edit existing tasks, and mark tasks as completed. 


### Reflection
What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that plain HTML, CSS, and JS does not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

Node.js allows for server-side JavaScript programming, which allows for more efficient and scalable web applications. MongoDB brings a flexible and scalable data storage solution that is able to handle data more effiently and secure. In the previous assignment that only used HTML CSS and JS for example, instead of this type of data storage, I used just the computer local storage which isnt as scalable and secure as this.
