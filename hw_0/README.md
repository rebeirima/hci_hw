# Programming HW0: Make a To-Do App with just HTML, CSS, and JS


Created a to Do list app following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-N_w0Op84

## Instructions to open the prototype:
1. To use this app, download and save the ZIP file from this repository to your computer and extract the contents to a folder
2. Navigate to the extracted folder and look for the index.html file
3. Double-click on the main HTML file to open it in your default web browser

App is able to add to do list items, check them off, delete them, and sort through completed and incompleted task items. To do list items are stored in local storage, so when you close and re open the app, the items are still there.
