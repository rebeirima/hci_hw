# Implement a user-testable version of When2Meet

### Key distinguishing characteristics between Doodle Poll and When2Meet that were implemented in this app from the user entering their availability side:
**User Interface:** While Doodle has a more modern and visually appealing interface, When2Meet offers a simpler and more basic layout. This minimal design makes it easy for users to quickly navigate the scheduling process without any distractions or clutter. <br>
**Scheduling Method:** Unlike Doodle, which shows users specific dates and times for a meeting, When2Meet focuses on selecting a single time slot that works for everyone. Users can freely pick their available time slots, which allows for more flexibility and customization options. <br>
**Availability Display:** When2Meet stands out from Doodle by displaying a visual representation of each participant's availability. This allows users to quickly see which time slots are available or unavailable for each participant. In contrast, Doodle shows a counter of participants that selected each time slot, which may not be as clear or visually appealing. <br>


## Features Implemented
This app is a minimum user-testable implementation of a user's experience entering in their availability. There is hard coded data showing a pre-existing "when2meet" where there are 7 days where a series of time slots that a user can pick from. There is also hard coded data to reflect imaginary others' availability on the group's availabilty side.
1. Users can enter their name and select which time slots fit with their schedule on the seven days by clicking the slots to toggle
2. Users can submit their name and time slots selected
4. As the user clicks the time slots that work for their schedule, the group's availabilty automatically changes. If the user clicks time slots that others in the group clicked, the time slot is displayed in a darker green.
