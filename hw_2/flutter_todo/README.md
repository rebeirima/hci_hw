A To Do List App Flutter project.
I followed this tutorial to create this app: https://medium.com/flutter-community/simple-to-do-list-app-in-flutter-26abc50db741

## Getting Started Instructions (for Macs)

1. Install Flutter on your machine by following the instructions here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install. Make sure to also install Xcode.
2. Clone the code for the To-Do List app from this GitHub repository
3. Open Terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
4. Run the command flutter doctor to make sure your environment is set up correctly
5. Run the command flutter pub get to download all the dependencies required for the app.
6. Connect your iOS device to your Mac via USB and open Xcode or you can use one of the simulator enviorments in Xcode
7. In Xcode, go to File > Open and navigate to the ios folder in the root directory of the project. Select the Runner.xcworkspace file and click Open
8. In Xcode, select your iOS device as the build target or the simulator iphone
9. Click the Play button to build and run the app on your device.


Reflection: What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

Unlike the previous set of technologies that were primarily used for web development, this app is built using Flutter, which is a mobile app development framework. Flutter allows developers to create fast, responsive, and beautiful native mobile apps for both Android and iOS platforms with a single codebase. Flutter uses a widget-based approach to build UI, which means that UI elements are treated as widgets. This is different from the HTML/CSS/JS combo, where HTML and CSS were used to structure and style the UI, and JS was used to add interactivity.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
